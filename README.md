**Rise Beyond Language**

![Octavia Dashboard](documentation/assets/dashboard_preview.png)

## 🌌 Overview

**Octavia** is a next-generation, cloud-native video translation platform designed to break down language barriers with cinematic quality. Built with a "Liquid Glass" aesthetic, it combines powerful AI models with a stunning, intuitive user interface.

Unlike traditional tools that simply overlay text, Octavia preserves the original experience. Our **Magic Mode** separates vocals from background music, translates the speech with context-aware LLMs, clones the original speaker's voice, and seamlessly remixes everything back together—all while keeping the original background audio intact.
